##My OpenStack (Kilo based) by Docker
I want to setup a OpenStack environment ( Juno for the first version and now Kilo ). As Docker is more flexible and easy to upgrade to next fast changing OpenStack version, I desided try to use Docker to run each OpenStack service ( as possible ). 

>**NOTE:** This is only for myself by now. If you want to dockerize your OpenStack env. you should try [kolla](https://github.com/stackforge/kolla).
